This is a TODO for future versions of the program (which probably will not be released as this was only a 'warm-up' assignment) or for people interested in working on the code.

+ Improve the display of error messages (they should be more descriptive).

+ Improve error handling: what if the user creates a board bigger or smaller than specified?

+ Check the number limits in the code: what would happen if the user created a board with dimensions bigger than UINT_MAX? How about the file parsing code?

+ Read other board file formats (eg BMP and some usual formats for representing Game of Life boards).

+ Split the code in game.c into more specific files (maybe create some game_board_* functions).
